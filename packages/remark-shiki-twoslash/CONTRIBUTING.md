## Setup

Using a triangular workflow is recommended. `main` will pull from and push to `origin/main`. `upstream-main` will pull from `upstream/main` and push to `origin/upstream-main`.

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/shikijs/twoslash
git config remote.pushdefault origin
git config push.default current
git checkout upstream-main
git fetch upstream
git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main
git checkout main
```

## Getting the latest changes from upstream

```
git fetch
git fetch upstream
git diff upstream/main..upstream-main -- ./packages/remark-shiki-twoslash ./
```

and port any diff over to `main`.
