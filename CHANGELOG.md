# shiki-twoslash

## 2.0.0
### Major Changes

- e0574f2: In the process of adding the option to have JSDoc comments included in the hovers, I changed the exposed types for `renderCodeToHTML` in `shiki-twoslash` this major sermver bump only really affects users who are using the `shiki-twoslash` API directly which I've not heard of any yet.
