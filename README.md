# @olets shiki

Forks of some [Shiki org](https://github.com/shikijs) repos.

Motivated by a desire to have access to the latest [Shiki themes](https://shiki.style/themes) in Eleventy v3 without switching to [@shikijs/markdown-it](https://shiki.style/packages/markdown-it), the Markdown fence parsing of which doesn't play nice with the transform I apply to [my articles'](https://www.olets.dev/posts/) code blocks.
